# frontend-2 üè¨

The replacement for our old Vue 2 Vue CLI frontend SPA app. This one's built with Vue 3, Nuxt 3, Tailwind and is server side rendered. Should be a faster and nicer experience both for our devs and our users!

Look at the [nuxt 3 documentation](https://v3.nuxtjs.org) to learn more.

## TODO

- Validate client-side build, it seems to over-bundle lodash and potentially some other things

## Setup

Make sure to install the dependencies:

```bash
yarn install
```

And create an `.env` file from `.env.example`.

## Development

Start the development server on http://localhost:8081

```bash
yarn dev
```

### Typed GraphQL

Type your queries & fragments using the `graphql()` helper from `~~/lib/common/generated/gql` and then run `yarn gqlgen` (or `yarn gqlgen:watch` to run it in watch mode) to generated TS typing information for these GQL documents.

### Troubleshooting

#### ESLint results doesn't update after GQL type regeneration

Restart the ESLint plugin through VSCode's command palette, this is a bug with the ESLint plugin

#### GraphQL codegen throws an error like "Unknown fragment XXX" or something else that doesn't make sense

Sometimes the codegen throws misleading errors and the issue is actually something completely different so I suggest removing the new graphql fragments/operations you've added one by one until the generation works again, to isolate the problematic graphql code. And then thoroughly investigate the fragments/operations you've added, because you might have a syntax error somewhere.

### Testing

We have some E2E tests here. You can run them the following way:

1. `yarn test:e2e` - Run tests on dev server. Can be slow since it will re-build the app on each test run.
1. `yarn test:e2e:static` - Run tests on static build. This is faster since it doesn't need to rebuild the app on each test run.
1. `yarn test:e2e:browser` - Run tests on static build in a headed browser with GUI. Can be useful for debugging.

#### Running E2E tests in a browser

Make sure you run this to ensure deps are available: `npx playwright install-deps`

## Production

Build the application for production:

```bash
yarn build
```

You can serve the production build locally by running `yarn preview` afterwards.

Checkout the [deployment documentation](https://v3.nuxtjs.org/guide/deploy/presets) for more information.
